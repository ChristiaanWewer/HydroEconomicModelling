# HydroEconomicModelling
Model code for the hydro economic modelling course.

This GitHub repository has all the code for our group project of the TU Delft course Hydroeconomic Modelling CIE4400.
Our project group consists of Jing Deng (5563283), Gerardos Drakonakis (4605632) and Christiaan Wewer (4965701).

The code has the following setup:
In the folder 'output' the csv files and the graphs of the model are available. In the folder 'model' the code of the model is available. There are 6 files available to run the model, these start with 'B_run_model'. These files are to run different scenarios that are elaborated in the report of the project. These .py files are solely to have different input variables and to assign different model parameters. The model itself is in the 'pyfunctions' folder. The files 'Utility_Point_scatter.py' and '
plot_ppf_utility.py' are to make extra figures from the model output data.
